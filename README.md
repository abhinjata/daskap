A community helper bot, powered by Groq AI, LangChain & LangGraph RAG (Retrieval Augemented Generation) Framework, designed to help a select club/community's Organising Committee understand and serve the people of the club better. The model that was used is "llama-3.3-70b-versatile", and a vector database powered by Chroma. I will write more about it hold on it's pretty cool but here's an example persona that it generated 

----

Generated Persona:
 **Persona Name:** Ethan Thompson
**Estimated Age:** 20-22 years old

**Goals:**
Ethan is a passionate and driven individual who is deeply interested in Computer Science. His primary goal is to contribute to the club's true purpose and ideology, which he believes is being slightly deviated from due to the focus on dopamine-oriented events. He aspires to be part of the Organizing Committee (OC) to drive the club's vision forward and promote more technical and project-based activities.

**Behaviour:**
Ethan is an active and engaged member of the community, frequently attending events and participating in discussions. He is not afraid to share his opinions and suggestions for improvement, demonstrating his commitment to the club's growth and success. His high rating of the community (9/10) indicates that he is largely satisfied with the club, but has some areas of concern that he hopes to address.

**Interests:**
Ethan's interests are deeply rooted in Computer Science, and he is enthusiastic about exploring and working on projects related to the field. He values the technical and intellectual aspects of CS and believes that the club should focus more on these areas rather than entertainment-oriented events.

**Noted Suggestions for Improvement:**
Ethan's suggestion to shift the focus from dopamine-oriented events to more nerdy and cool CS projects is a key area for improvement. The club could benefit from incorporating more technical workshops, hackathons, or project-based activities to cater to members like Ethan who are eager to learn and contribute to the field. Additionally, providing more opportunities for members to take on leadership roles or contribute to the OC could help retain talented and motivated individuals like Ethan.

Extracted Suggestions:
 Here are the constructive suggestions the user made for improving the club:

* Focus more on "nerdy and cool CS projects" rather than dopamine-oriented events like video games.
* The user also expressed a desire to be part of the Organizing Committee (OC) to help push the true ideology of the club ahead, implying that they want to contribute to the club's direction and decision-making process.
